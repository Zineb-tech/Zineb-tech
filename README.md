<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Zineb Drissi Kaitouni</h1>

# 💫 About Me:

I am a Software Engineer who enjoys turning ideas into real, working products. I like the challenge of starting from scratch, building things step by step, and improving them with purpose. 

For me, it's not just about writing code — it's about creating systems that are useful, reliable, and meaningful. I care about writing clean, readable code and building solutions that are easy to maintain and improve over time.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

🤖 Exploring foundational & applied machine learning concepts

Exploring Machine Learning through hands-on projects and courses, with a focus on supervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

🛠️ Backend Development with Spring Boot

Building secure APIs using Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.x, and JWT authentication. Applying clean code and scalable architecture principles.

💡 Building Stronger Problem-Solving Skills

Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms through LeetCode.
